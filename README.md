# Sampling_Assignment
Introduction
This project explores the effectiveness of different sampling techniques for creating a balanced dataset for a machine learning model. The dataset used is initially unbalanced, so random over-sampling and under-sampling techniques are used to create a balanced dataset. Five different sampling techniques are then applied to this balanced dataset, and the accuracies of the resulting samples are compared using five different machine learning models.

Sampling Techniques
The following five sampling techniques were used in this project:

1. Simple Random Sampling: A basic sampling technique where each data point in the dataset has an equal probability of being selected in the sample.

2. Stratified Sampling: A sampling technique where the population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on a specific characteristic, and samples are taken from each stratum in proportion to the population.

3. Systematic Sampling: A sampling technique where every nth element in the population is selected for the sample, with n being a fixed interval.

4. Cluster Sampling: A sampling technique where the population is divided into clusters, and a sample of clusters is randomly selected. Then, all members of the selected clusters are included in the sample.

5. Convenience Sampling: A non-probability sampling technique where the sample is chosen based on its convenience to the researcher.
